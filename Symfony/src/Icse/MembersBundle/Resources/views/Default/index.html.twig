        You have not yet paid for this year's membership.
        You can do so by visiting <a href="https://www.imperialcollegeunion.org/shop/club-society-project-products/string-ensemble-products/">the online shop</a> and making a one-off payment of Â£15, which lasts for the whole academic year.
        Membership fees go towards the cost of snacks, drinks and music hire, as well as the many other things that ICSE has to pay for!

I have purchased membership, yet the website is still telling me I have not yet paid.

Please could you look into this?

Thanks
