'Dear ICSE

I have purchased membership, yet the website is still telling me I have not yet paid.

Please could you look into this?

Thanks

<p>
    You have not yet purchased this year's membership.
    You can do so by visiting

    <a href=
{% if product is not null and product.url %}
    "{{ product.url }}"
{% else %}
    "https://www.imperialcollegeunion.org/shop/club-society-project-products/string-ensemble-products/"
{% endif %}
    >the online shop</a>

    and making a one-off payment

{% if product is not null %}
    of Â£{{ product.price | replace({".00" : ""}) }},
{% endif %}

    which lasts for the whole academic year.
    Membership fees go towards the cost of snacks, drinks and music hire, as well as the many other things that ICSE has to pay for!
</p>

<p>
    If you have in fact paid membership and this notice still appears, please
    <a href="mailto:icse@imperial.ac.uk?{{ {subject: 'ICSE Membership', body: email_body} | url_encode }}" >get in touch</a>
    and we'll make sure the system is up to date.
</p>
